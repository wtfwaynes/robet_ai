### ROBET – Decentralized AI-Powered Prediction Markets Platform

---

## **Introduction**  
ROBET is a decentralized, AI-powered Prediction Markets platform designed to empower users to create and participate in bets on **any event**. Unlike traditional platforms like Polymarket, ROBET removes the restrictions of whitelisting and human resolvers, enabling **real-time, scalable, and transparent betting**.

## How we do it?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant R as Robet (AI on Telegram)
    participant XC as CosmWasm Contract (on Xion)
    participant AI as ChatGPT & Gemini
    participant FG as Feegrant Module

    U->>R: Message on Telegram with broadcast link + question (e.g., "Will there be a goal?")
    R->>R: Analyze feasibility of creating a bet
    alt Feasible?
        R->>XC: Deploy new bet contract on Xion
        R->>U: Reply with Xion bet link
    else Not Feasible
        R->>U: Decline or provide reason
    end
    U->>FG: Place bets using gasless transaction
    FG->>XC: Forward bet placement to CosmWasm contract
    note over U,XC: Users place their wagers until the bet closes

    par Event Ends
        R->>R: Retrieve relevant video/audio feed
        R->>AI: Analyze outcome (e.g., "Was a goal scored?")
        AI->>R: Provide resolution result
        R->>XC: Resolve bet contract on Xion
        XC->>U: Distribute payouts to winners via feegrant
    end
```

## **Features**  
### 1. **Seamless Bet Creation**  
- Users create bets by sharing a broadcast link (e.g., sports matches, political speeches) with a question like:  
  *“Will a goal be scored in the next minute?”*  
- ROBET analyzes the feasibility and deploys a **smart contract bet** on the **Xion blockchain**, providing users with a **Xion Bet** link for participation.  

### 2. **Gasless Transactions via Feegrant Module**  
- ROBET integrates the **feegrant module** on Xion, allowing users to participate in bets without paying gas fees directly.  
- This ensures seamless transactions and lowers entry barriers for users.

### 3. **AI-Powered Resolution**  
- ROBET retrieves video or audio feeds post-event and uses AI models like **ChatGPT** and **Gemini APIs** to determine outcomes.  
- Winners receive their rewards instantly via blockchain, ensuring transparency and speed.  

### 4. **Incentivized Bet Creators**  
- ROBET rewards bet creators, introducing a **creator economy** for interactive, engaging bets.  
- Content creators can add live bets during streams to enhance audience engagement.  

### 5. **Decentralized and Scalable**  
- CosmWasm contracts ensure trustless execution and payout.  
- AI handles a large volume of custom, short-term bets without delays.

## **How It Works**  

### **Step 1: Creating a Bet**  
1. Send a tweet with a broadcast link (e.g., a YouTube stream or sports match) and your question.  
2. ROBET evaluates the question’s feasibility in real time.  
3. If valid, ROBET creates a **CosmWasm contract** on Xion and replies with a **Xion Bet** link for user participation.  

### **Step 2: Joining a Bet**  
1. Participants click on the Xion Bet link and join the bet using gasless transactions via the **feegrant module**.  
2. Funds are held in the smart contract until the event resolves.

### **Step 3: Resolving the Bet**  
1. Once the event ends, ROBET retrieves relevant feeds.  
2. AI (using **ChatGPT** and **Gemini APIs**) determines the result.  
3. Winners are automatically awarded their share of the pot directly to their wallets via the feegrant module.
